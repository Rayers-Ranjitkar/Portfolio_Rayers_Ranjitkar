			<h2>About me</h2>

			<p id="para1">Hi, I’m Rayers Ranjitkar, a dedicated Computer Science student with a growing passion for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data, and front-end development. I love exploring how technology works behind the scenes—whether it’s the systems powering IoT devices, drones, automation, smart gadgets, or modern networks. Working with JavaScript and building real projects has strengthened my interest in creating clean, efficient, and meaningful digital experiences.</p>

			<p id="para2">I’m deeply curious about intelligent systems and how data and algorithms can solve real-world problems. As I continue to develop my skills, I aim to move further into AI and ML, pursue advanced studies, and contribute to building innovative technologies that make life smarter and more efficient. Technology keeps evolving, and I’m excited to grow with it—learning, experimenting, and building along the way.</p>
